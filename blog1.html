      <p> Recent release in amazon prime video soorarai pottru directed by sudha kongara is winning hearts everywhere. The movie aimed for 2020 summer release. Due to COVID-19 and lockdown of theatres pushed release date for many days and finally released in amazon prime video on 13 november,2020. The movie is extracted from SIMPLY FLY- an autobiography written by captain gopinath the owner of air deccan. This movie was a dream project to director sudha kongara and worked on script for more than 5 years.</p>

      <p>The movie is all about how an ex-airforce officer from nowhere with a dream to run an airline with a ticket cost of 1 rupee. His struggles with the society wich mocks him that he cannot achieve this and a super successful airline as his compitetor how maaran wins is the story. The society which thinks that all luxury is only for the riches is that maaran tries to break. He not only wants to break the cost barrier but also the caste barrier and make everyone fly. The story runs in madurai backdrop in early 2000s. The technical team did a good job in taking audience back to 2000s. The camera work by nikethbommi is extraordinary. The frames and colour pallete is set perfectly. Music by GV prakash is the best in his recent works. Both songs and background score made scenes much more beautiful.</p>

      <p>The performance by suriya is something audience wanted from the actor from a long time. Every scene audience can only see maaran and his struggles. There are some scenes where suriya made everyone fall for him. The director did a reading session with every actor that made some of their work easy. Lead female actress aparna balamurali was too good in role of bommi. Director sudha kongra managed to write a strong female character for bommi. A girl from madurai studied only till grade 12 but has a intelligence to excel at many things. She was a strong support to maaran and some of audeince even feel that everyone should have a wife like bommi who understands and supports them. The movie has more characters and every character has a story. Every character has completeness to their role.</p>
