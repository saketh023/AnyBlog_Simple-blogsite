      <h1>The Apple Blog: Why the iPhone SE has many things going for it</h1>

      <p>Finally, Apple did launch a successor to the iPhone SE. And it is still called the iPhone SE, maybe add a ‘2020’ to avoid confusion. Yes, it’s a bit foolhardy to predict what Apple would do. The company always manages to pack in a final twist.</p>

      <p>The iPhone SE has a lot going for it. To start with is the $399 price point. While the general perception is that this is meant for emerging markets like India, it could actually have a lot more impact on Apple’s core markets like US, Europe and Australia. In all these markets, Apple dominates and the Android is relegated to a Number 2 spot, almost a working-class phone. A $399 phone offers Apple a chance to eat into that Android market share too. Remember, in all these markets the iPhone SE will be sold mostly as a carrier offering with just a monthly rental and hence be much more affordable.</p>
        
      <p>In other markets, it will still be the most affordable Apple iPhone, though in India that is still an expensive price tag. A budget phone in the US, the iPhone SE will be an expensive mid-run device in India. But it is still a new iPhone with the latest processor and the aspirational value of Apple.</p>
